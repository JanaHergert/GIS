#Vacation Packing List Web Application
=====================================

##Project Description
-------------------

The Vacation Packing List web application is a tool designed to assist users in better organizing their holiday travels by allowing them to create a comprehensive packing list. This application aims to help users avoid forgetting important items and make their travels stress-free.

##Site Structure
--------------

The web application consists of the following main pages:

1.  *Home Page*: Users can create a new packing list or access their existing ones from this page.
2.  *Create Packing List*: On this page, users can create a new packing list for their trip. They can add, remove, or edit items and customize the list according to their needs.
3.  *Saved Packing Lists*: Users can access their saved packing lists, view them, and make modifications as necessary.

##Functionality of the Web Application
------------------------------------

The Vacation Packing List web application enables users to efficiently manage their travel preparations. Here are some key features of the application:

*   *Create Packing List*: Users can create a new packing list by selecting various items from a predefined list or adding their own items.
*   *Customizable List*: The packing list is fully customizable. Users can add, remove, or edit items to tailor it to their individual requirements.
*   *Saved Packing Lists*: Users can save their packing lists for future access and reuse.

##Management of Information and Data
----------------------------------

The web application manages information about the created packing lists and the items they contain. Packing lists consist of a collection of items that users need for their trip. These items can be added by the user or selected from a predefined list. The application securely stores this data, allowing users easy access and management of their information.
In addition to the mentioned features, it should be noted that initially, the lists can only be printed and saved as PDFs. Afterwards, it should be possible to save the packing lists in local storage so that they are still available when the page is revisited. Finally, the lists should be saved in a database and accessible on a subpage where all saved lists can be found.
